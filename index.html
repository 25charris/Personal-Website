<h3>Bio</h3>
<p>I am a pretty good student and I typically get pretty good grades. I don't mind school and I really enjoy time off. I would like to take a welding class in highschool because I like to learn new skills.</p>
<p>I play football and lacrosse currently. I varisty lettered my freshman year at Northridge Highschool in football and I'm training hard in the off season to potentially get playing time on Varisty this season.</p>
